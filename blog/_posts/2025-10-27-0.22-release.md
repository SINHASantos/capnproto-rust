title: 0.22 â€” async methods
author: dwrensha
---

Today I have published version 0.22.0 of the
[capnp](https://crates.io/crates/capnp),
[capnpc](https://crates.io/crates/capnpc),
[capnp-futures](https://crates.io/crates/capnp-futures),
and [capnp-rpc](https://crates.io/crates/capnp-rpc),
crates.

The new release enables idiomatic usage of
`async` and `await` in RPC method implementations,
taking advantage of the
"[return position impl Trait in traits](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3425-return-position-impl-trait-in-traits.html)"
feature stabilized in Rust 1.75. The relevant changes landed in pull request
[#593](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/pull/593).
Thank you [@luisholanda](https://github.com/luisholanda) for
the contribution!

## how it was before


Suppose we had a capnp schema file `example.capnp` declaring the following interface:

```
interface Foo {
  bar @0 (x :UInt16) -> (y :UInt16);
}
```

In previous versions, capnpc-rust would generate a Rust trait with the following signature:

```rust
pub mod foo {
  trait Server {
    fn bar(&mut self, foo::BarParams, foo::BarResults) -> Promise<(), Error>;
  }
  // ...
}
```

The return type `Promise<(), Error>` allowed implementations of the method to
use asynchronous code, like this:
```rust
Promise::from_future(async move {
  // ... do some asynchronous stuff here
})
```

However, there were some problems with this setup:

1. Rust users accustomed to `async/await` [found it annoying](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto-rust/issues/168)
to need to manually construct a `Promise` like this.

2. The `?` operator did not work inside such a method body without enabling the unstable `try_trait_v2` feature.

3. There was no way to get access to the borrowed `&mut self` parameter from within the `async` context, because `Promise::from_future()` requires that its input be `'static`.


## the new way

Starting in version 0.22.0, the generated trait has the following signature:

```rust
pub mod foo {
  trait Server {
    fn bar(&self,
           foo::BarParams,
           foo::BarResults) -> impl Future<Output=Result<(), Error>> + '_;
  }
  // ...
}

```

Now user-provided implementations can use the `async fn` syntax like this:

```rust

impl foo::Server for FooImpl {
  async fn bar(&self, foo::BarParams, foo::BarResults) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // ... do some asynchronous stuff here, possibly using the `?` operator,
    // and possibly using &self after an await point.
  }
}
```

This solves all three of the problems noted above!

## the price of progress

This is a breaking change. All implementations of RPC traits will need to be
updated to account for the change in method signature.

In particular, because the `&mut self` parameter has changed to
an immutable `&self` parameter, RPC objects may need to add their own
interior mutability. This can typically be done by wrapping
data in `Cell<T>` or `RefCell<T>`.
[This commit to the Sandstorm Collections app](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/collections-app/commit/36bcd3231f935dab9edcfd4eac1aa77879e6991d) is an example of what such an update might look like.

Moreover, getting this all to work required adding some `async/await` in
the generated method dispatch code. Therefore, capnpc-rust no longer
supports generating code for Rust editions 2015 and 2018.
